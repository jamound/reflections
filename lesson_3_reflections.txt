When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It's useful when I wish to share it with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because manually I have more control of it, avoiding possible bugs when new changes incorporates into mine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: When I want to copy (clone) someone's remote repository directly on GitHub to work on it but you are not an authorized collaborator.
    Clone: When I want to copy a remote repository into my local machine or copy a local repository into another local directory. It's recommended to clone remotes only if it's yours or if you are an collaborator. Otherwise, fork is the best choice.
    Branch: When I want to make changes keeping safe the main version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
