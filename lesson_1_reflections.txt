How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    With diff you can focus only on the lines of code that changed and find  bugs more quickly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It gives me control of all changes, so I can fix problems in less time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You don´t commit more than necessary.
    Cons: It takes more time and discipline from the programmer.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it depends the purpose of each system. For Git´s purpose, it makes more sense than Google Drive or Dropbox, for example.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows all the commits made by users. So, when you want to check changes between 2 commits, just use git diff and the commits's id's.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Accessing the history of changes I can go back to a previous version that all is working fine. It´s totally safe.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try on an simple app project, maybe.
